/// 1. A reference cannot outlive its referent.

/// # Aliasing
///
/// 1. Variables and pointers alias if they refer to overlapping regions of memory.
///
/// The definition of "alias" that Rust will use likely involves some notion of
/// **liveness** and **mutation**: we don't actually care if aliasing occurs if there
/// aren't any actual writes to memory happening.
