//meory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the
//compiler checks at compile time. No run-time costs are incurred for any
//of the ownership features.

//1.Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
//2.There can only be one owner at a time.
//3.When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
