//! Lifetimes, borrowing, and ownership exercises.
//!
//! Work through each module in order. Each file has:
//! - A short concept explanation
//! - One or more functions to implement (replace `todo!()` with your code)
//! - Tests that pass when your implementation is correct
//!
//! Run tests for one exercise: `cargo test exercise_01`
//! Run all tests: `cargo test`
